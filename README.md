game idea

- a roguelike tag game
- timer till enemies get hostile
- obstacles to jump over
- obstacles to hide under
- can see only in light
- map is dark // fog of war // (memory mechanics from project zomboid where object remain on the place where you last saw them but dissapear slowly) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmE1OFPFLXc)
- when hostile should surviveand find the exit to go back one level
- learn powerup by defeating bosses
- bosses are hidden and not mandatory but enemies keeps getting harder, 2-3 levels after boss level enemies will have a chance to have the boss's abilities and the only way to get that abality is to go back a level and search for the boss


- Boss abalities will include stuff like teliportation, reducing players eyesight, AOE attacks, time manipulation etc.
